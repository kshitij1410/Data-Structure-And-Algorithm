Types:
1) undirected graph

--> Sum of degree=2*E;
--> Max no of nodes= (v*(v-1))/2

2) directed graph

-->Sum of indegree=E
-->Sum of outdegree=E
-->Max no of nodes= v*(v-1)

3) directed weighted graph
4) undirected weighted graph
5)  cyclic undirected graph
6)  cyclic directed graph
7)  undirected Acyclic graph
8) Directed Acyclic graph (DAG)

TERMINOLOGY:

1)walk - repeated edge //ex- v1,v2,v4,v2
2)path - not repeated edge //ex- v1,v2,v4 
3)cyclic: There exist a walk that begins and ends with same vertex


//Application of BFS
1)shortest path in an  unweighted graph
2)peer to peer networdk
3)social networking sites
4)cycle detection
